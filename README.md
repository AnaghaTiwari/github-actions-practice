## GitHub Actions Practice (intro to CI/CD @ OSAI)
This is a repo to demonstrate the power of GitHub actions.
We have implemented a basic Python calculator ([calculator.py](calculator.py)) incorrectly.
All functions in that file are broken.
There are also some syntax issues to fix . . .

Note: You should not need to clone this repo; try testing changes via GitHub actions.
