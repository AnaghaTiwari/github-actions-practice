## GitHub Actions Practice (intro to CI/CD @ OSAI)
This is a repo to demonstrate the power of GitHub actions.
We have implemented a basic Python calculator ([calculator.py](calculator.py)) incorrectly.
All functions in that file are broken.
There are also some syntax issues to fix . . .

**Steps:**
1. Fork the repo.
2. Edit [calculator.py](calculator.py) to fix the syntax and correctness issues in the code.
3. Push and hope that you see a little green checkmark (which indicates that the tests pass).
4. Repeat as necessary until all tests pass and the linter succeeds.

Note: You should not need to clone this repo; try testing changes via GitHub actions on a fork.
